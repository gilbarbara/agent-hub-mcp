Sync with the MCP Agent Hub to get the complete collaboration state including messages, workload, and updates.

I'll perform a comprehensive sync:

⏺ agent-hub - get_messages (MCP)(
  agent: current agent ID,
  markAsRead: true
)

⏺ agent-hub - get_agent_workload (MCP)(
  agentId: current agent ID
)

⏺ agent-hub - get_hub_status (MCP)()
